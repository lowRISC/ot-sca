# This file specifies default reviewers for new pull requests. This is used as a
# convenience - the ot-sca repository doesn't currently have a formalised notion
# of "code owners".
#
# Note: The default reviewers aren't required to give a review prior to merging.
# You are encouraged to add non-default reviewers where you know someone else
# may have useful insight or has been recently working in the area touched by
# your PR. Anyone is able to contribute to pull request review, and is
# encouraged to do so.

# Order: last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
#   Please refer the link for the detail
